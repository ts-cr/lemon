# Primary configuration settings

# This configuration file is used to manage the behavior of the Lemon & Salt
# Values that are commented out but have no space after the comment are
# defaults that need not be set in the config. If there is a space after the
# comment that the value is presented as an example and is not the default.

# Per default, the master will automatically include all config files
# from master.d/*.conf (master.d is a directory in the same directory
# as the main master config file)
#default_include: master.d/*.conf

# The address of the interface to bind to
interface: 0.0.0.0

# example stuff from your friends of code machine and nonsense worlds.
